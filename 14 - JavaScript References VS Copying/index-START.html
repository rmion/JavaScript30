    let age = 100;
    let otherAge = age;
    console.log(age, otherAge); // 100 100

    let name = "Robert";
    let otherName = name;
    console.log(name, otherName); // Robert Robert
    name = "Billy";
    console.log(name, otherName); // Billy Robert

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ["Robert", "Laura", "Mitzi", "Lucy"];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    players[3] = "Tommy";

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(team); // ["Robert", "Laura", "Mitzi", "Tommy"]

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: "Robert Mion",
      age: 29
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person); // { name: "Robert Mion", age: 29, number: 99 }

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 29, age: 12 });
    console.log(person) // { name: "Robert Mion", age: 29 }

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person} // Woah!

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const cap4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person)); // Poor man's deep clone
